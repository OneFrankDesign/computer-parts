# NOT Gate (Inverter)

## Overview

The NOT gate is the most fundamental logic gate. It takes a single input and produces the complement (opposite) of that input.

## Truth Table

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0     | 1      |
| 1     | 0      |

## Description

The NOT gate (also called an inverter) outputs the opposite of its input. If the input is `1`, the output is `0`, and vice versa. It is the simplest logic gate and a building block for all other gates.

## Boolean Expression

$$\text{Out} = \overline{A}$$
